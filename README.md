# Validateur

Validateur is a validation library inspired by Ruby's ActiveModel. Validateur is functional: validators are
functions, validation sets are higher-order functions, validation results are returned as values.


## Usage

Since these are very early days of the library, it is fair to say that it is *completely unusable* to anyone
other than the author.


## This is a Work In Progress

Validateur is very much a work in progress and right now, there is nothing to
see here, really.


## Continuous Integration
